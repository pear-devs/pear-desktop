# Global Keybinds Plugin

This plugin enables system-wide **global keyboard shortcuts** for the music player. It allows you to control media playback, volume, and track ratings (like/dislike) from anywhere in your operating system, even when the application is minimized or not in focus.

## 🚀 Features

* **Global Control:** Control your music while working in other applications.
* **Customizable:** Remap any action to your preferred key combination via the plugin settings.
* **Smart Double-Tap:** A unique feature that allows you to toggle the player window's visibility by double-pressing the Play/Pause shortcut.

## 🎹 Default Shortcuts

By default, the plugin is configured with the following key combinations (using `Shift` + `Ctrl` to avoid conflicts with common system shortcuts):

| Action | Default Shortcut |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Play / Pause** | `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `Space` |
| **Next Track** | `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `Right Arrow` |
| **Previous Track** | `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `Left Arrow` |
| **Volume Up** | `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `Up Arrow` |
| **Volume Down** | `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `Down Arrow` |
| **Like Track** | `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `=` |
| **Dislike Track** | `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `-` |

## ⚙️ Configuration & Options

You can customize the behavior and key assignments through the plugin menu.

### Remapping Keys
Click on the **"Keybinds Management"** option in the plugin menu. A prompt will appear allowing you to press the new key combination you wish to assign to each action.

### Window Visibility Toggle (Double Tap)
* **Option:** `Double Tap to Toggle Window Visibility`
* **Default:** `Enabled`
* **How it works:**
    * **Single Press** on the Play/Pause shortcut: Toggles media playback.
    * **Double Press** (quickly): Shows or Hides the application window.

> **Note:** If you disable this option, the Play/Pause shortcut will only control playback, regardless of how fast you press it.
